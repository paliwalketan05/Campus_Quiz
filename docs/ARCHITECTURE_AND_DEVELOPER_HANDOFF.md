## 1. Executive Repository Inspection & Implementation State Audit

A repository inspection at `D:\Quiz` established the original baseline on `main`; the remaining-phase implementation is being carried on `feat/remaining-backend-phases` and has not been merged:

### Components Present in the Original Baseline
* **Database Migrations (`database/01_schema.sql` through `database/06_fix_student_response_record.sql`)**: 6 migration files applied, tracked, and verified on Neon PostgreSQL 18.6.
* **Master SQL Script (`database/campusquiz_complete.sql`)**: 3,300+ line consolidated script containing the full schema, triggers, and procedures for bootstrapping fresh environments.
* **Python Database Runner (`database/verify_and_migrate.py`)**: Production-grade migration and verification tool with transactional execution, connection sanitization, and automated permission auditing.
* **SQL Integration Test Suite (`database/test_suite.sql`)**: 14 test blocks (35 distinct assertions) passing with 100% clean rollback.
* **Python Migration Unit Test Suite (`database/test_verify_and_migrate.py`)**: 78 automated unit tests passing under `unittest`.
* **Backend HMAC Token Utility (`database/auth_utils.py`)**: Cryptographic HMAC-SHA256 actor context ticket generator matching PostgreSQL's `fn_verify_actor_context`.
* **Configuration Files**: `.env.example`, `.gitignore`, `requirements.txt`, `README.md`, `ACCOMPLISHMENTS.md`.

### Implemented Foundation and Remaining Work
* **Backend Application**: The FastAPI foundation and Phases 2-9 (authentication, tenant-scoped administration, question/quiz authoring, publishing, sessions, attempts, autosave, finalization, results, and faculty analytics) are implemented and unit-tested. Live database verification remains unverified because no database credentials are configured in this workspace.
* **Frontend Application Code**: A React/Vite SPA is implemented for student, faculty, and administrator workflows. Production build passes; browser/API integration remains pending.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **To Incoming Developers:** Phases 0-10 are implemented on the feature branch. CI checks and a staging handover guide are present. Complete staging DB verification, browser end-to-end/concurrency testing, backup restore rehearsal, and provider deployment before production use.

## 2. Project Overview & Core Mission

CampusQuiz is an institutional assessment platform engineered for continuous classroom evaluation, quizzes, midterms, and finals in colleges and universities.

### The Problem It Solves
1. **Academic Dishonesty & Session Leaks**: Commercial quiz systems frequently leak answer keys or option correctness through frontend client payloads, inspectable network requests, or weak access controls.
2. **Multi-Tenant College Contamination**: Traditional multi-tenant applications rely on application-level filtering (`WHERE college_id = ?`). A single developer oversight in an API endpoint leaks one college's proprietary question bank or student data to another.
3. **Autosave Race Conditions & Submission Freezes**: Distributed student clients submitting concurrently over campus Wi-Fi experience network drops, stale packet overwrites, and lock contention during mass submissions.
4. **Flawed Negative-Marking Systems**: Assessment platforms often fail to cleanly distinguish between questions where negative marking was explicitly disabled versus inherited, and artificially floor negative marks at zero.

### Intended User Personas
* **Students**: Sit for assigned quizzes under server-enforced time windows, submit answers with atomic version-gated autosave, and view detailed explanations only when results are authorized for release.
* **Faculty**: Author reusable subject-scoped questions, assemble quizzes, configure hierarchical negative marking, schedule concrete classroom sessions, monitor ongoing attempts, and release graded results.
* **Institutional Administrators**: Manage colleges, departments, branches, academic years, classes, and student enrollments with strict validation ensuring students have exactly one active core enrollment per academic year.

## 4. Complete System Architecture

### Logical Architecture & Trust Boundaries

The system is partitioned into three distinct security and operational tiers:
1. **Untrusted Client Tier (Browser / Mobile)**: Never possesses database credentials, never receives correct option flags (`is_correct`), and never communicates directly with PostgreSQL.
2. **Application Tier (FastAPI)**: Connects to PostgreSQL exclusively via the restricted role `campusquiz_app`. Authenticates HTTP requests, generates cryptographic HMAC actor context tickets, and executes database stored procedures.
3. **Database Tier (Neon PostgreSQL 18.6)**: Acts as the ultimate authority on academic integrity, security bounds, and scoring. Stored procedures run with `SECURITY DEFINER` privileges owned by `campusquiz_definer`.

## 5. Database Architecture & Data Model

The database comprises **21 tables** partitioned into four logical domains. All tables reside in schema `public` and use UUID primary keys generated by `gen_random_uuid()`.

### Complete Schema Table Reference

#### 1. System & Authentication
* **`app_auth_config`**: Definer-only configuration table storing internal cryptographic secrets (`auth_hmac_secret`, `auth_hmac_secret_fallback`). Never readable by `campusquiz_app`.
* **`colleges`**: Multi-tenant institutional roots. Contains `name`, `code` (Unique), `is_active`.
* **`roles`**: System role catalog (`ADMIN`, `FACULTY`, `STUDENT`).
* **`users`**: Central identity table. Contains `college_id`, `email`, `password_hash`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `token_version` (revocation counter), `is_active`. Enforces lowercase email.
* **`user_roles`**: Composite role mapping table `(user_id, role_code)`. Enforces multi-college integrity via composite FK `(college_id, user_id)` referencing `users(college_id, id)`.

#### 2. Academic Infrastructure
* **`departments`**: Academic departments within a college (e.g., Computer Science). Enforces `UNIQUE(college_id, code)`.
* **`branches`**: Academic disciplines under a department (e.g., Software Engineering).
* **`academic_years`**: Institutional calendars (e.g., `2025-2026`). Enforces `chk_academic_years_date_range (start_date < end_date)`. Contains partial unique index:
  ```sql
  CREATE UNIQUE INDEX uq_ay_single_current ON academic_years (college_id) WHERE is_current = TRUE;
  ```
* **`classes`**: Concrete student cohorts (e.g., CSE-3A). Bound to `college_id`, `branch_id`, and `academic_year_id`. Enforces semester ranges ($1 \le \text{sem} \le 12$) and year of study ($1 \le \text{year} \le 6$).
* **`subjects`**: Courses taught within departments (e.g., CS101 Algorithms).
* **`faculty_profiles`**: Faculty metadata (`employee_id`, `department_id`, `designation`). Enforces uppercase employee IDs (`chk_faculty_emp_uppercase`).
* **`student_profiles`**: Student metadata (`roll_number`, `registration_number`). Enforces uppercase roll numbers (`chk_student_roll_uppercase`).
* **`faculty_assignments`**: Authoritative record linking faculty to a subject, class, and academic year.
* **`student_enrollments`**: Authoritative student class membership. Contains partial unique index guaranteeing only one active core enrollment per student per academic year:
  ```sql
  CREATE UNIQUE INDEX uq_student_single_core_enrollment
  ON student_enrollments (student_user_id, academic_year_id)
  WHERE enrollment_type = 'CORE' AND is_active = TRUE;
  ```

#### 3. Assessment Blueprint & Question Bank
* **`questions`**: Reusable question repository. Supports `MCQ`, `TRUE_FALSE`, and `MULTIPLE_SELECT`. Stores `default_marks` (default 1.0000) and `default_negative_penalty` (default 0.0000).
* **`question_options`**: Options belonging to questions. Stores `option_text`, `is_correct` (boolean), `display_order`. **Protected:** `campusquiz_app` cannot SELECT `is_correct`.
* **`quizzes`**: Reusable assessment blueprints created by faculty. Stores `title`, `instructions`, `default_duration_minutes`, `total_marks`, `status` (`DRAFT`, `PUBLISHED`, `ARCHIVED`), and `default_result_visibility`.
* **`quiz_questions`**: Junction table ordering questions within a quiz. Supports individual `marks_override` and `negative_penalty_override`.

#### 4. Runtime Execution & Scoring Engine
* **`quiz_sessions`**: The live or scheduled classroom event. Carries `session_code` (unique 6-digit access code), `start_window_time`, `end_window_time`, `duration_minutes`, `status` (`SCHEDULED`, `ACTIVE`, `PAUSED`, `COMPLETED`, `CANCELLED`), and `snapshot_json`.
  * **Protected:** `snapshot_json` is frozen upon activation by `trg_freeze_session_snapshot` and is excluded from `campusquiz_app` SELECT permissions.
* **`quiz_attempts`**: Individual student exam sitting. Stores `started_at`, `deadline`, `submitted_at`, `finalized_at`, `status` (`IN_PROGRESS`, `FINALIZED`, `ABANDONED`), `submission_type` (`MANUAL`, `AUTO_TIME_EXPIRED`, `ADMIN_TERMINATED`, `SESSION_TERMINATED`), and `total_score`.
  * **Protected:** Direct INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE revoked from `campusquiz_app`. Total score supports negative numbers with no check constraint (`total_score >= 0`).
* **`student_responses`**: Student answers to snapshot questions. Stores `selected_option_ids` (UUID array), `client_version`, `client_submitted_at`, `server_received_at` (database-authoritative timestamp), `is_evaluated`, `is_correct`, and `awarded_marks`.
  * **Protected:** Immutable once attempt is finalized via `trg_guard_student_responses`. Direct mutation of `awarded_marks`, `is_evaluated`, `is_correct`, and `server_received_at` blocked for application role.

## 6. Stored Procedures & Database Operations Reference

All business logic mutations on assessments execute through PostgreSQL `SECURITY DEFINER` stored procedures. Bypassing these procedures via direct table updates is impossible due to table and column-level permission revocations.

### Stored Procedure Directory

#### 1. `sp_publish_quiz`
* **Signature**: `(p_quiz_id UUID, p_actor_user_id UUID, p_auth_signature TEXT)`
* **Returns**: `TABLE (quiz_id UUID, status VARCHAR(20), total_marks NUMERIC(8,2))`
* **Actor & Auth**: Faculty author or Admin. Verified with role `'ANY'` at gate, verified as quiz creator inside procedure.
* **Validation**:
  * Calls `fn_validate_quiz_for_publishing(p_quiz_id)`.
  * Verifies quiz has at least one question.
  * Verifies every question has at least two options.
  * Verifies every question has at least one correct option.
  * Verifies True/False questions have exactly two options and exactly one correct option.
  * Verifies Single-Choice MCQ has exactly one correct option.
* **Effects**: Atomically sums question marks and marks quiz as `PUBLISHED`.

#### 2. `sp_activate_quiz_session`
* **Signature**: `(p_session_id UUID, p_actor_user_id UUID, p_auth_signature TEXT)`
* **Returns**: `JSONB` (The frozen `snapshot_json`)
* **Actor & Auth**: Assigned Faculty or Admin.
* **Validation**: Session must be in `SCHEDULED` status. Current timestamp must be before `end_window_time`.
* **Effects**:
  * Resolves hierarchical negative marking precedence for every question.
  * Builds the immutable `snapshot_json` capturing all questions, options, marks, and penalties.
  * Transitions session status to `ACTIVE`.
  * Sets `actual_started_at = clock_timestamp()`.

#### 3. `sp_pause_quiz_session` / `sp_resume_quiz_session`
* **Signature**: `(p_session_id UUID, p_actor_user_id UUID, p_auth_signature TEXT)`
* **Returns**: `VARCHAR(20)` (Updated status: `PAUSED` or `ACTIVE`)
* **Effects**: Transitions session state. Validated by transition trigger `trg_validate_session_status`.

#### 4. `sp_complete_quiz_session`
* **Signature**: `(p_session_id UUID, p_actor_user_id UUID, p_auth_signature TEXT)`
* **Returns**: `VARCHAR(20)` (`COMPLETED`)
* **Effects**: Marks session `COMPLETED`, records `actual_ended_at`.

#### 5. `sp_cancel_quiz_session`
* **Signature**: `(p_session_id UUID, p_actor_user_id UUID, p_auth_signature TEXT)`
* **Returns**: `VARCHAR(20)` (`CANCELLED`)
* **Effects**: Marks session `CANCELLED`, rendering all associated in-progress attempts abandonable.

#### 6. `sp_release_session_results`
* **Signature**: `(p_session_id UUID, p_actor_user_id UUID, p_auth_signature TEXT)`
* **Returns**: `TIMESTAMPTZ` (`results_released_at`)
* **Effects**: Stamps `results_released_at = clock_timestamp()` for sessions configured with `UPON_FACULTY_RELEASE`.

#### 7. `sp_start_quiz_attempt`
* **Signature**: `(p_session_id UUID, p_actor_user_id UUID, p_auth_signature TEXT)`
* **Returns**: `TABLE (attempt_id UUID, status VARCHAR(20), deadline TIMESTAMPTZ, duration_minutes INT, snapshot_questions JSONB)`
* **Actor & Auth**: Enrolled student. Must supply signature minted for role `'STUDENT'`.
* **Concurrency Locking**: Executes `SELECT ... FROM quiz_sessions qs JOIN classes c ... FOR SHARE OF qs;` to lock the session row without encountering permission conflicts on `classes`.
* **Idempotency**: If the student already started this session, returns their existing attempt and deadline idempotently without creating duplicates.
* **Sanitization**: Strips all `is_correct` flags and sensitive authoring metadata from `snapshot_questions` before returning payload to the client.

#### 8. `sp_save_student_response`
* **Signature**: `(p_attempt_id UUID, p_question_id UUID, p_selected_option_ids UUID[], p_is_marked_for_review BOOLEAN, p_client_version INT, p_client_submitted_at TIMESTAMPTZ, p_actor_user_id UUID, p_auth_signature TEXT)`
* **Returns**: `TABLE (result_status VARCHAR(25), saved_version INT)`
* **Possible Statuses**:
  * `ACCEPTED`: Answer version was strictly greater than current version; successfully saved.
  * `IDEMPOTENT_RETRY`: Exact same options submitted with identical version; acknowledged cleanly without re-executing.
  * `STALE_REJECTED`: Client submitted a version lower than already saved on server.
  * `VERSION_CONFLICT`: Conflicting options submitted on the same version counter.
* **Validation**:
  * Rejects options not belonging to the question (`INVALID_OPTION_SUBMITTED`).
  * Rejects duplicate option IDs in the array (`DUPLICATE_OPTION_SUBMITTED`).
  * Rejects multiple options for single-choice questions (`CARDINALITY_VIOLATION`).
  * Allows empty array (`'{}'`) to clear an answer.
  * Enforces attempt ownership (`v_attempt.student_user_id = p_actor_user_id`).
  * Enforces deadline ($clock\_timestamp \le v\_attempt.deadline$).

#### 9. `sp_finalize_attempt`
* **Signature**: `(p_attempt_id UUID, p_submission_type VARCHAR(25), p_actor_user_id UUID, p_auth_signature TEXT)`
* **Returns**: `TABLE (final_status VARCHAR(20), total_score NUMERIC(8,2), finalized_at TIMESTAMPTZ)`
* **Submission Types**:
  * `MANUAL`: Initiated by the owning student. Requires `p_actor_user_id = student_id` and role `'STUDENT'`.
  * `AUTO_TIME_EXPIRED`: Invoked when timer elapses. Enforces that current timestamp is past deadline.
  * `ADMIN_TERMINATED`: Requires role `'ADMIN'`.
  * `SESSION_TERMINATED`: Requires session faculty.
* **Execution & Scoring**:
  * Iterates across `snapshot_json->'questions'`.
  * Calculates MCQ and proportional multiple-select marks with high precision (`NUMERIC(12,6)`).
  * Evaluates unattempted questions as zero without inserting dummy response rows.
  * Sums marks and records `total_score` on `quiz_attempts`.
  * Marks attempt `FINALIZED`.
* **Idempotency**: If attempt is already `FINALIZED`, returns existing status and score immediately without re-scoring.

#### 10. `sp_get_student_attempt_results`
* **Signature**: `(p_attempt_id UUID, p_actor_user_id UUID, p_auth_signature TEXT)`
* **Returns**: `TABLE (attempt_id UUID, status VARCHAR(20), is_results_released BOOLEAN, total_score NUMERIC(8,2), question_breakdown JSONB)`
* **Visibility Release Policy**:
  * Session faculty and college admins always receive full results immediately.
  * For students:
    * `IMMEDIATELY`: Released upon attempt finalization.
    * `AFTER_SESSION_ENDS`: Released only when `quiz_sessions.status = 'COMPLETED'`.
    * `UPON_FACULTY_RELEASE`: Released only when `quiz_sessions.results_released_at IS NOT NULL`.
  * If unreleased: Returns `is_results_released = FALSE`, `total_score = NULL`, `question_breakdown = NULL`.

### Cryptographic HMAC Actor Authentication

To prevent user spoofing across shared application connection pools, database procedures do not trust client-supplied user IDs without cryptographic verification.

The backend service constructs a colon-delimited string:
$$\text{Payload} = \text{user\_id} \mathbin{:} \text{token\_version} \mathbin{:} \text{role} \mathbin{:} \text{expires\_epoch}$$

* `user_id`: UUID of the authenticated caller.
* `token_version`: Integer matching `users.token_version`.
* `role`: Enforced role (`STUDENT`, `FACULTY`, `ADMIN`, or `ANY`).
* `expires_epoch`: Unix timestamp (seconds) until ticket expiration (default 300s / 5 minutes).

#### Ticket Structure
$$\text{Ticket} = \text{expires\_epoch} \mathbin{:} \text{HMAC-SHA256}(\text{Payload}, \text{Secret})$$

#### Verification Lifecycle in PostgreSQL (`fn_verify_actor_context`)
1. **Format Validation**: Ensures ticket matches `<expires_epoch>:<hmac_hex>`.
2. **Replay Expiry Check**: Immediately rejects tickets where $\text{EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM clock\_timestamp())} > \text{expires\_epoch}$.
3. **Secret Retrieval**: Reads active secret from `app_auth_config.auth_hmac_secret`.
4. **User Verification**: Queries `users` to confirm user exists, is active, and matches current `token_version`.
5. **HMAC Recalculation**: Computes expected HMAC over `<user_id>:<user.token_version>:<required_role>:<expires_epoch>`.
6. **Zero-Downtime Rotation**: If primary hash fails, recalculates using `auth_hmac_secret_fallback` (if present).
7. **Role Verification**: Validates caller holds required role in `user_roles`.

## 8. High-Precision Scoring Engine & Negative Marking Architecture

Scoring is executed exclusively within the database by `sp_finalize_attempt`.

### Negative Marking Precedence Hierarchy
Negative marking rules are inherited through a two-tier hierarchy:

1. **Enablement Inheritance**:
   $$\text{Session Enablement} \longrightarrow \text{Quiz-Question Override} \longrightarrow \text{Quiz Default} \longrightarrow \text{FALSE}$$
2. **Penalty Inheritance**:
   $$\text{Session Penalty} \longrightarrow \text{Quiz-Question Override} \longrightarrow \text{Quiz Default} \longrightarrow \text{Question Bank Default}$$

* **Explicit Zero Preservation**: A penalty of `0.0000` is preserved as an explicit override. If negative marking is disabled, penalty is strictly forced to `0.000000`.

### Scoring Formulas

#### 1. Single-Choice MCQ & True/False
* **Selected Correct Option**: $\text{Awarded} = +\text{Question Marks}$
* **Selected Incorrect Option**: $\text{Awarded} = -1.000000 \times \text{Configured Penalty}$
* **Unattempted / Empty**: $\text{Awarded} = 0.000000$

#### 2. Proportional Multiple-Select
Partial credit is awarded proportionally for each correct option selected, with penalties deducted for incorrect selections:

$$\text{Awarded Marks} = \left( \frac{c_{\text{selected}}}{c_{\text{total}}} \times \text{Question Marks} \right) - \left( i_{\text{selected}} \times \text{Penalty} \right)$$

* $c_{\text{selected}}$: Count of correct options selected by student.
* $c_{\text{total}}$: Total number of correct options defined for the question.
* $i_{\text{selected}}$: Count of incorrect options selected by student.
* If all correct options and no incorrect options are chosen, full marks are awarded.

#### 3. Attempt Total Score
$$\text{Total Score} = \text{ROUND}\left( \sum \text{Awarded Marks}, 2 \right)$$
* **Negative Total Score Allowed**: There is **no artificial zero-floor**. If penalties exceed marks, student total scores can be negative (e.g., `-2.50`), preserving academic integrity.

## 9. Backend Architecture (FastAPI Core) `[PHASES 1-4 IMPLEMENTED]`

The backend uses **FastAPI**, **Pydantic v2**, and **SQLAlchemy 2.0 async Core**. Phase 1 provides the application factory, settings, restricted database connection, dependency, parameterized database-function caller, and health routes. Phase 2 adds Argon2 login, JWT access/refresh tokens, current-user authentication, token-version revocation, and HMAC tickets for database procedures. Phase 3 provides ADMIN-only tenant-scoped APIs for the caller's college, academic years, departments, branches, classes, subjects, faculty and student profiles, faculty assignments, and student enrollments. Phase 4 provides FACULTY/ADMIN question-bank and quiz-authoring APIs. Faculty authoring is restricted to their active subject assignments and authored questions; admins are scoped to their college. Option read responses intentionally omit `is_correct`, and authoring responses never expose correctness flags, preserving the client answer-confidentiality guarantee and the restricted database column grant. Questions linked to non-draft quizzes are immutable, and quiz assembly/edits are limited to drafts.

The implemented backend currently lives in `app/main.py`, `app/core/`, `app/db/`, `app/schemas/`, `app/services/`, and `app/api/`. `GET /api/v1/auth/me` validates access-token version, account status, college, and current roles against PostgreSQL on each request. Login uses the college ID and normalized email because email uniqueness is college-scoped. Refresh tokens retain their original expiry; logout increments the user's database `token_version`, revoking all of that user's outstanding tokens. Per-device refresh rotation is not claimed because the current schema has no refresh-session table. `AUTH_HMAC_SECRET` must match the active `app_auth_config` secret, while `JWT_SECRET_KEY` is a separate secret.

### Stored Procedure Execution Pattern in SQLAlchemy
Backend services must call stored procedures using parameterized `text()` calls.

```python
# Example: app/db/sp_caller.py
from sqlalchemy import text
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncConnection

async def call_start_quiz_attempt(
    conn: AsyncConnection,
    session_id: str,
    user_id: str,
    signature: str
):
    query = text("""
        SELECT attempt_id, status, deadline, duration_minutes, snapshot_questions
        FROM sp_start_quiz_attempt(:session_id, :actor_id, :sig);
    """)
    result = await conn.execute(query, {
        "session_id": session_id,
        "actor_id": user_id,
        "sig": signature
    })
    return result.mappings().one()
```

## 10. Frontend Architecture (Interactive Quiz UI) `[IMPLEMENTED; BUILD VERIFIED]`

The frontend is a React/TypeScript single-page application built with Vite,
React Router, and Tailwind CSS. Its current workflows are in
[`frontend/src/pages/`](../frontend/src/pages/):

- Authentication and role selection with protected routes.
- Student session discovery, quiz attempts with debounced autosave, countdown,
  submission, and released results.
- Faculty question/quiz authoring, session lifecycle, analytics, and result
  release.
- Administrator academic records and account management.

The API client uses credentialed requests and reads only the non-HttpOnly CSRF
cookie to set `X-CSRF-Token` on unsafe requests. Access and refresh tokens are
HttpOnly cookies; no JWT is persisted in browser storage. Attempt question
snapshots are cached in session storage to support reloads, and omit correctness
data. Production compilation passes; browser-based integration against a live
backend remains pending.

---

## 11. REST API Contract & Endpoint Roadmap `[PHASES 1-9 IMPLEMENTED; LIVE DB VERIFICATION PENDING]`

Protected endpoints accept the HTTP-only access cookie; bearer access tokens
remain supported for API clients. Login is unauthenticated. Refresh and logout
use the HTTP-only refresh cookie. Cookie-authenticated unsafe methods require a
matching readable CSRF cookie and `X-CSRF-Token` header.

### 1. Authentication
* `POST /api/v1/auth/login`: Accepts `college_id`, email, and password; verifies Argon2 hashes and sets access/refresh HttpOnly cookies plus a readable CSRF cookie. The JSON response contains the user profile, not JWTs.
* `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh`: Reads the refresh cookie, validates it, and rotates the access cookie while preserving the refresh token's original expiry.
* `POST /api/v1/auth/logout`: Requires cookie-auth CSRF validation, revokes tokens by incrementing `users.token_version`, and clears auth cookies.
* `GET /api/v1/auth/me`: Validates the access cookie (or bearer token for API clients) and returns the current account and role data from the database.

### 2. Question Bank & Quiz Authoring (FACULTY / ADMIN)
All endpoints require authentication by access cookie or bearer token. Faculty users need an active faculty assignment for the subject; admin access is restricted to the token's college. List endpoints accept `limit` (1-500, default 100) and `offset` (default 0).
* `GET|POST /api/v1/questions`: List questions (optionally filtered by `subject_id`) or create an MCQ, TRUE_FALSE, or MULTIPLE_SELECT question with its options. Creation validates option order and correct-answer cardinality, then writes the question and options atomically. The authenticated user is recorded as author.
* `GET|PATCH|DELETE /api/v1/questions/{question_id}`: Read, update, or deactivate an accessible question. `DELETE` is a soft deactivation. Faculty can edit only their own questions; admins can edit any question in their college. A question attached to a published or archived quiz cannot be changed or deactivated.
* `PUT /api/v1/questions/{question_id}/options`: Atomically replace the full option set on an editable question. Correctness is accepted in the request but is never included in the response; the caller must retain its authoring input if it needs to display the marked answer during the current editing flow.
* `GET|POST /api/v1/quizzes`: List accessible quizzes or create a draft associated with the authenticated author.
* `GET|PATCH|DELETE /api/v1/quizzes/{quiz_id}`: Read or edit an owned/admin-accessible draft; `DELETE` archives the quiz to preserve history. Only drafts are editable.
* `PUT /api/v1/quizzes/{quiz_id}/questions`: Atomically replace the draft quiz's ordered question set. Every question must be active, belong to the same college and subject, and have a unique order. `marks_override`, `negative_marking_enabled_override`, and `negative_penalty_override` preserve `NULL` inheritance and explicit zero penalties. `total_marks` remains database-computed at publishing in Phase 5.

### 3. Institutional Administration (College ADMIN)
All endpoints below require an ADMIN role and are restricted to the token's college. Authentication uses the access cookie or a bearer token. List endpoints accept `limit` (1-500, default 100) and `offset` (default 0).
* `GET /api/v1/admin/college` and `PATCH /api/v1/admin/college`: Read or update the authenticated administrator's own college. College creation and deletion require a future platform-admin provisioning design.
* `GET|POST /api/v1/admin/academic/{resource}` and `GET|PATCH|DELETE /api/v1/admin/academic/{resource}/{id}`: CRUD for `academic-years`, `departments`, `branches`, `classes`, `subjects`, `faculty-assignments`, and `enrollments`. Enrollment and assignment deletion deactivates the record to preserve history; foreign-key or uniqueness conflicts return 409.
* `GET|POST /api/v1/admin/faculty` and `GET|PATCH|DELETE /api/v1/admin/faculty/{user_id}`: Provision and manage faculty accounts and profiles. Create requests require an initial password (12-128 characters), which is Argon2-hashed; account, role, and profile creation is one transaction.
* `GET|POST /api/v1/admin/students` and `GET|PATCH|DELETE /api/v1/admin/students/{user_id}`: Provision and manage student accounts and profiles. Deletion disables the account, revokes its tokens, and deactivates enrollments.

### 4. Quizzes (Faculty / Admin)
* `POST /api/v1/quizzes`: Create draft quiz.
* `GET /api/v1/quizzes/{quiz_id}`: Fetch quiz draft with questions.
* `POST /api/v1/quizzes/{quiz_id}/publish`: Calls `sp_publish_quiz`.

### 5. Sessions (Faculty / Admin)
* `POST /api/v1/sessions`: Schedule quiz session.
* `GET /api/v1/sessions` and `GET /api/v1/sessions/{session_id}`: List and read sessions owned by the faculty member, or all sessions in an admin's college.
* `POST /api/v1/sessions/{session_id}/activate|pause|resume|complete|cancel`: Calls the corresponding session lifecycle procedure.
* `POST /api/v1/sessions/{session_id}/release-results`: Calls `sp_release_session_results`.
* `GET /api/v1/sessions/{session_id}/analytics`: Returns tenant-scoped participation, scores, and question performance to the owning faculty member or college admin.

### 6. Quiz Taking (Student)
* `GET /api/v1/student/sessions`: Lists currently active sessions for the student's enrolled classes.
* `POST /api/v1/student/sessions/join`: Looks up an active session code and verifies enrollment before returning the safe lobby details.
* `POST /api/v1/attempts/sessions/{session_id}/start`: Calls `sp_start_quiz_attempt`. Returns attempt metadata and sanitized questions.
* `GET /api/v1/attempts/{attempt_id}`: Reads the student's own attempt and autosaved response state without evaluation fields.
* `PUT /api/v1/attempts/{attempt_id}/responses/{question_id}`: Calls `sp_save_student_response`.
  * **Payload**: `{"selected_option_ids": ["uuid..."], "is_marked_for_review": false, "client_version": 2}`
* `POST /api/v1/attempts/{attempt_id}/submit`: Calls `sp_finalize_attempt` with `MANUAL` or `AUTO_TIME_EXPIRED`. Students can finalize only their own attempt; the API verifies expiry against database time before auto-finalization.

### 7. Results (Student / Faculty / Admin)
* `GET /api/v1/attempts/{attempt_id}/results`: Calls `sp_get_student_attempt_results`; students receive no score or breakdown until the configured release rule permits it. The owning faculty member and same-college admin may view authorized results.

## 14. Developer Environment & Onboarding Guide (Windows / Linux / macOS)

### Prerequisites
* **Python**: Version `3.14+` (Python 3.10+ compatible).
* **Git**: `2.40+`.
* **PostgreSQL Client Tools** (optional): `psql` for manual inspection.

### Setup Instructions

```powershell
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/pragya-shree/Quiz.git
cd Quiz

# 2. Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1   # Windows PowerShell
# source .venv/bin/activate    # Linux / macOS

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Configure Environment Variables
cp .env.example .env
```

### Environment Configuration (`.env`)
Populate your `.env` file with your staging connection parameters. **Never commit `.env`!**

```env
# Neon Direct (Unpooled) Endpoint — Always use direct, NOT -pooler!
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:[PASSWORD]@ep-small-shape-b3bddxrz.c-4.ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech/campusquiz_db?sslmode=require

# Restricted Application Role Connection (Used for Backend Service)
APP_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://campusquiz_app:[APP_PASSWORD]@ep-small-shape-b3bddxrz.c-4.ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech/campusquiz_db?sslmode=require

# Internal HMAC Signing Key (Matches app_auth_config in DB)
AUTH_HMAC_SECRET=your_staging_hmac_secret_key_minimum_32_chars_long

# JWT Settings
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_signing_secret_key_minimum_32_chars_long
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=15
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS=7
```

> [!WARNING]
> **Neon Connection Notice**: Always connect using the direct unpooled endpoint (`ep-xyz...neon.tech`). Do not use the connection-pooler endpoint (`ep-xyz-pooler...neon.tech`) for migrations or definer execution; PgBouncer in transaction mode breaks session-level `SET ROLE` commands.

## 16. Step-by-Step Development Roadmap (Phases 0 through 12)

```
===================================================================================
Project Roadmap: Master Implementation Sequence
===================================================================================
```

* **`PHASE 0: Database Architecture & Hardening` `[COMPLETE]`**:
  * Schema DDL, constraints, triggers, HMAC authentication, scoring engine, 6 migrations applied and verified on Neon.
* **`PHASE 1: Backend Foundation Scaffold` `[COMPLETE]`**:
  * Objective: Establish FastAPI directory structure, Pydantic settings, SQLAlchemy async connection pool under `campusquiz_app`.
* **`PHASE 2: Authentication & Identity Service` `[IMPLEMENTED; LIVE DB VERIFICATION PENDING]`**:
  * Objective: User login, Argon2 password verification, JWT issuance, `auth_utils.py` integration for HMAC ticket generation.
* **`PHASE 3: Institutional Administration API` `[IMPLEMENTED; LIVE DB VERIFICATION PENDING]`**:
  * Objective: Tenant-scoped CRUD for college metadata, academic years, departments, branches, classes, subjects, faculty/student profiles, assignments, and enrollments. Platform-level college provisioning is deferred until a platform-admin role is defined.
* **`PHASE 4: Question Bank & Quiz Authoring API`**:
  * Objective: Question creation (MCQ, True/False, Multiple Select), option authoring, quiz assembly, marks override configuration. `[IMPLEMENTED; LIVE DB VERIFICATION PENDING]`
* **`PHASE 5: Publishing & Session Lifecycle Engine` `[IMPLEMENTED; LIVE DB VERIFICATION PENDING]`**:
  * Objective: `POST /api/v1/quizzes/{quiz_id}/publish`, scheduled session creation/listing, and session controls calling `sp_activate/pause/resume/complete/cancel`. API session responses omit the answer-bearing activation snapshot.
* **`PHASE 6: Student Quiz Discovery & Lobby` `[IMPLEMENTED; LIVE DB VERIFICATION PENDING]`**:
  * Objective: Tenant- and enrollment-scoped active session listing and session-code lookup.
* **`PHASE 7: Quiz Attempt Engine & Autosave Dispatcher` `[IMPLEMENTED; LIVE DB VERIFICATION PENDING]`**:
  * Objective: Idempotent attempt start, sanitized snapshot questions, own-attempt state reads, and version-gated autosave through stored procedures.
* **`PHASE 8: Submission, Finalization & Scoring` `[IMPLEMENTED; LIVE DB VERIFICATION PENDING]`**:
  * Objective: Manual and database-deadline-checked auto-finalization through `sp_finalize_attempt`.
* **`PHASE 9: Result Visibility & Analytics` `[IMPLEMENTED; LIVE DB VERIFICATION PENDING]`**:
  * Objective: Database-enforced student result release, authorized faculty/admin results, and session participation/score/question analytics.
* **`PHASE 10: Frontend UI Development & Integration` `[IMPLEMENTED; BUILD VERIFIED]`**:
  * Objective: React/Vite application for student, faculty, and administrator workflows. Live API/browser integration remains pending.
* **`PHASE 11: End-to-End, Load & Concurrency Testing` `[CI IMPLEMENTED; STAGING TESTS PENDING]`**:
  * Objective: CI runs backend and frontend checks. Browser end-to-end and high-concurrency autosave/submission tests require a separately provisioned staging database and disposable student accounts; do not run against production.
* **`PHASE 12: Production Deployment & Staging Handover` `[GUIDE PREPARED; DEPLOYMENT PENDING]`**:
  * Objective: Follow `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` to configure environment separation, validate backups/restores, and perform authorized staging acceptance before production promotion.

---

## 17. Git, Branching & Team Collaboration Conventions

To ensure zero conflicts and clean code reviews:

1. **`main` Branch Protection**:
   * Direct pushes to `main` are strictly prohibited.
   * `main` must always represent tested, working, and deployable code.
2. **Feature Branch Naming Convention**:
   * `feat/backend-scaffold`
   * `feat/auth-jwt-service`
   * `feat/quiz-authoring-api`
   * `fix/session-locking-alias`
3. **Pull Request Protocol**:
   * Every PR must include passing unit and integration tests.
   * At least one teammate code review required before merging.
4. **Migration Discipline**:
   * **Never modify already-applied migrations (01 through 06)**.
   * Any future database change must be authored as a new sequential migration (e.g., `07_new_feature.sql`) and registered in `verify_and_migrate.py`.

## 18. Non-Negotiable Architecture Invariants & Rules

1. **Database as the Sole Source of Truth**: Business rules enforced by check constraints, unique indexes, and triggers must never be replicated or relaxed in application code.
2. **Never Bypass Stored Procedures**: Application code must never issue direct `UPDATE` or `DELETE` statements on `quiz_attempts` or `student_responses`. All runtime state changes must flow through `sp_*`.
3. **Least-Privilege Connection Identity**: The backend must connect as `campusquiz_app`. It must never run queries under `neondb_owner` or `campusquiz_definer`.
4. **Answer Confidentiality Guarantee**: The backend must never query or expose `question_options.is_correct` to students prior to official result release.
5. **No Artificial Zero-Floor**: Student net scores must support negative values if penalties exceed marks. Do not clamp scores to zero.
6. **Immutable Finalized Responses**: Once an attempt is finalized, its responses are permanently locked by `trg_guard_student_responses`. Never attempt to edit finalized answers.
7. **Parameterized SQL Only**: Never concatenate SQL strings. Always use parameterized queries (`:param`) to prevent SQL injection.
8. **Zero Secrets in Source Control**: Never commit `.env` files, production passwords, or HMAC keys.

## 19. Known Limitations, Incomplete Features & Open Decisions

1. **Remaining APIs & Frontend Not Yet Implemented**: Authentication, institutional administration, quiz authoring, publishing, and session lifecycle APIs are implemented. Student discovery, attempts, autosave, submission, results, analytics, and all UI layers remain to be built.
2. **WebSocket Real-Time Monitoring `[PROPOSED]`**: Live student attempt monitoring currently relies on REST polling. Implementing a WebSocket or Server-Sent Events (SSE) gateway for live faculty proctoring is scheduled for Phase 9.
3. **Session Reconnect Grace Period `[OPEN DECISION]`**: Current deadline enforcement is absolute based on `deadline TIMESTAMPTZ`. The team must decide whether a 60-second network disconnection grace period should be introduced during final auto-submission.
4. **Question Types Expansion `[DEFERRED]`**: Coding questions, file uploads, and essay evaluations are deferred to Phase 13 (Post-MVP).

Follow this checklist sequentially to start working on CampusQuiz:

- [ ] **Step 1: Environment Setup**: Clone repo, create Python virtual environment, install `requirements.txt`.
- [ ] **Step 2: Database Connectivity**: Configure `.env` with unpooled Neon endpoint and verify connection with `python database/verify_and_migrate.py --status`.
- [ ] **Step 3: Run Baseline Tests**: Execute the migration-runner and backend `unittest` commands above.
- [ ] **Step 4: Run SQL Verification**: Execute `python database/verify_and_migrate.py --tests-only` (Confirm 35/35 notices and 9/9 permissions passing).
- [ ] **Step 5: Review Architecture**: Read this document thoroughly, specifically Sections 6 (Stored Procedures), 7 (Security), and 8 (Scoring).
- [ ] **Step 6: Pick Roadmap Task**: Select the next assigned task from **Phase 3 (Institutional Administration API)**.
- [ ] **Step 7: Create Feature Branch**: Branch off `main` using `git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name`.
- [ ] **Step 8: Implement with Tests**: Write code with accompanying unit tests.
- [ ] **Step 9: PR Submission**: Open a Pull Request into `main` with detailed verification steps.
